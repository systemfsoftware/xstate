/**
 * Validate the constitution corpus against constitution-rule/v1.
 *
 * The enforcement doctrine applied reflexively (ENFORCEMENT.md): the
 * constitution's own format must fail a command, not a cited clause. Validates
 * every fenced ```yaml block against hardcoded schema fields (required_fields,
 * optional_fields, gate_values).
 *
 * Coverage is checked before schema. A rule the parser never reaches cannot be
 * validated, and an unterminated fence silently removes every rule after it from
 * the block — so counting ids in the raw text and comparing against ids parsed
 * out of blocks is the only way this gate can report on what it did NOT see.
 * Without that comparison a green run means "no rule I happened to parse was
 * malformed", which is not the claim the gate is making.
 *
 * The corpus is one file — the resident law, whole and always in context. Ids are
 * unique across it and citations resolve within it. A corpus path that is merely
 * absent is not the only shape of a vacuous pass: a file present and parsing but
 * declaring no rule scores identically to a healthy one, so the corpus path must
 * contribute at least one rule of its own.
 *
 * There is no backwards compatibility and no retirement ledger. A deleted rule
 * leaves its number vacant and a citation to it resolves to nothing, which is a
 * loud failure and needs no gate. Vacancy is named, not enforced: --against lists
 * ids vacated since the revision and corpus files absent at it on the success
 * line, because a green line that silently measured less is the vacuous pass this
 * gate exists to prevent. The one identifier defect that is NOT loud is an id that
 * survives while its rule changes underneath it: every citation keeps resolving,
 * to the wrong rule. No single revision can see that, so `--against <rev>`
 * recomputes it from git.
 *
 * Exit 0 clean, 1 with a named defect list, 3 unmeasurable — no identifiers matched
 * at all, reported distinctly because an id pattern that matches nothing scores a
 * healthy corpus and an id-free one identically.
