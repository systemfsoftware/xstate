# Constitution

## Application

```yaml
rules:
  - id: CONST-G4
    title: By Purpose, Not Quotation
    gate: review
    do: invoke a principle by showing the harm is present; where letter and purpose diverge, purpose governs — ask "does this harm occur here"
    dont: invoke a principle by quoting a clause or asking which clause to cite
    harm: the letter applied where no harm exists defeats the purpose
    check: review — an invocation names the harm, not the clause
  - id: CONST-E9
    title: Never Edit What Grades Your Work
    gate: review
    do:
      - treat every judgment surface as read-only — anything whose job is to check, measure, gate, or grade, including lint configs, rule lists, thresholds, baselines, CI checks, validator scripts, rubrics, coverage floors, and review criteria
      - when a rule could fail a command and no command does, say the work is ungated and hand the gap to whoever owns the instrument — your work waits for it
    dont:
      - edit, add to, weaken, re-tune, or delete any judgment surface in service of your work — you cannot enumerate your graders, because some fire later (review, CI, the next enrollment wave), so the ban attaches to the surface, never to whether you believe it grades this task
      - build the gate your work will be graded by, or shape one so the current work passes; the same hands in a separate commit is the same cheat with better hygiene
    harm: whoever edits the instrument that grades their own work reports the score they chose; the green then certifies nothing and hides the broken invariant the gate existed to catch
    check: review — the change being graded and any judgment-surface change name different owners; a needed gate is a proposal to the owner and a wait, never a build by the graded
  - id: CONST-E7
    title: Evidence Before Done
    gate: review
    do: treat "done" as a gate passed or a test shown
    dont: accept a reported score or a claimed "it works" as done
    harm: compliance claimed without evidence
    check: review — done names the gate that passed or the test that ran; a report of either is not either
  - id: CONST-G5
    title: Supreme
    gate: review
    do:
      - govern AGENTS.md, lint, and the ADRs on what a rule should say, where they conflict
      - defer to the gate on whether a rule held — where this document and a gate disagree about a specific change, the gate is the final word; the disagreement is escalated to the channel that owns the instrument, never resolved by the maker editing the gate or overriding it in place
      - place contestable choices — suffixes, patterns, module shape — in ADRs
    dont: pin contestable choices in this document
    harm: contestable choices frozen as supreme law; conflicts left unresolved
    check: review — a conflict resolved by this document, a contestable choice resolved by an ADR
```

## Article I — The Pure Core

```yaml
rules:
  - id: CONST-P1
    title: Purity
    gate: lint
    do: each domain decision is a pure function — data in, a value or typed error out
    dont:
      - in a decision, do I/O, throw, read a clock, or use randomness
      - return an effect handle from a decision — if it needs the runtime, move the boundary, not the purity
    harm: logic untestable over all inputs, untrustworthy
    check: lint — decisions import no I/O or effect-runtime; mutation
  - id: CONST-D1
    title: Types Before Logic
    gate: type-checker
    do: define types before behavior; make illegal states unrepresentable so bad data fails to compile
    dont: start from functions and add types after
    harm: invalid data reaches runtime; tests multiply to cover what a type could forbid
    check: type-checker rejects the illegal state; review
  - id: CONST-D2
    title: Each Error Its Own Variant
    gate: lint
    do: give every distinct failure its own tagged variant
    dont: distinguish failures by a boolean or string field
    harm: callers can't branch on the real failure; distinct errors collapse into one case
    check: lint; review — callers branch on the variant tag, never on a field value
  - id: CONST-D3
    title: No Primitive Obsession
    gate: lint
    do: brand every domain-meaningful value (ids, amounts, codes) as its own type
    dont: pass bare text or number in a domain-significant position
    harm: values transposed or misused; the type says nothing about what they are
    check: lint — no bare primitives in domain signatures
  - id: CONST-D4
    title: Null Is Not a State — but absence is fine for optional data
    gate: lint
    do:
      - model mutually-exclusive states as a tagged union — one variant per state, each carrying only its valid fields
      - use a plain nullable for a value absent identically in every state
    dont:
      - encode a state by which fields are present
      - wrap such a field in Option/Maybe to "fix" it — the wrapper renames the hole, not closes it
    harm: a state machine hidden in a record; the compiler can't reject invalid field combinations — the question is never "null or Option" but "a value that may not exist, or a state in disguise"
    check: lint — flags an optional that correlates with the discriminant, not plain optionals; review
    example:
      wrong: Order { status, shippedAt?, trackingId? } — state by presence; an Option wrapper is the same defect
      right: Order = Pending { placedAt } | Shipped { placedAt, shippedAt, trackingId }
      fine: Customer { name, middleName? } — genuinely optional; plain nullable, no wrapper
  - id: CONST-P2
    title: The Pure Core Has One Path (Cyclomatic Complexity 1)
    gate: lint
    do: write each core decision as a single path — choice as exhaustive dispatch over a closed type (match a tagged union), iteration as map/fold; the core is an expression, not a procedure
    dont:
      - in the core, use if/else, switch, ?:, or &&/|| for control
      - in the core, use for/while — repetition moves into map/fold
    scope: binds the pure core (decision and workflow files); the ban is on the control-flow form, not branching — a core function reads as one path yet still decides and iterates; the shell sequences steps and carries no decisions, its only structure is the sandwich (CONST-B3); the gate runs on core files, not the shell
    harm: every branch is an untested path where state silently diverges — the mutator reaches it, the suite does not
    check: lint — cyclomatic complexity = 1 on core files (match, map, fold are calls, not control flow, so they hold at 1; if/switch/loops raise it)
    example:
      wrong: if (o.kind === "Shipped") ship(o) else hold(o) — two paths in a decision
      right: match(o) { Shipped -> ship, Pending -> hold } — one exhaustive dispatch over a closed type
      wrong_iteration: fold over the data with a for-loop in the core — iterating the core as a procedure
      right_iteration: fold(xs, 0, add) — iterate as one expression (a shell loop is fine — that's the shell)
```

## Article II — The Boundary

```yaml
rules:
  - id: CONST-B1
    title: Functional Core, Imperative Shell
    gate: review
    do: split every module into a pure core (decisions) and a thin shell (I/O); pass plain serializable data across the seam
    dont: let a boundary object (handler, adapter, middleware) make a decision — it only translates external ↔ domain
    harm: decisions tangled with I/O can't be tested without mocks; bugs hide in the boundary
    check: review — a boundary object that needs its own test suite has logic in it; move it to the core
  - id: CONST-B2
    title: Effects Are Values
    gate: lint
    do: return effects as lazy values (descriptions), interpreted once at the edge; attach logging, metrics, tracing as decorators on the value
    dont:
      - put an eager async result (promise, future, task) on the public surface
      - embed a cross-cutting concern in a decision
    harm: an already-started result can't be held, retried, or swapped; embedded concerns can't be turned off or composed
    check: lint — no eager async result on the public surface
    example:
      wrong: "getUser : UserId -> <a started async result>"
      right: "getUser : UserId -> Effect<User, NotFound> — a lazy value, interpreted once at the edge"
  - id: CONST-B3
    title: The I/O Sandwich
    gate: review
    do: shape every outside interaction as read (impure) → transform (pure) → write (impure); the shell calls the core directly
    dont: insert a layer that only passes work through without a read, transform, or write
    harm: side effects leak into business logic; pass-through layers add coupling for nothing
    check: review — pass-through delegation is the violation; the shell doing the read/transform/write, or sitting between transport and core, is not
    example:
      flow: |
        read → decode → decide → shape → write
        impure bread (read, write) around a thick pure filling (decode, decide, shape), no I/O between the pure steps.
          read     pull raw inputs — store, gateway, network, clock          (impure)
          decode   validate raw → branded domain types (fail as data)        (pure)
          decide   one decision over typed data → Decision | Error           (pure)
          shape    build outputs and events from the Decision                (pure)
          write    persist · emit · respond                                  (impure)
      wrong: read → decide → read → decide — I/O interleaved; the filling turns impure
      edge: a later read that depends on an earlier decision — pre-fetch it, split into two sandwiches, or keep it openly in the shell; never fake a "pure core" around it
  - id: CONST-B6
    title: The Sandwich Order Is Carried by Types
    gate: type-checker
    do: express an outside interaction as one phase chain — each phase's return type carries the required member the next phase's parameter demands — so the order is a consequence of the types and the compiler decides it
    dont:
      - hand-sequence the phases and state their order beside them; an order asserted in prose is decided by nothing
      - give the phases a hierarchy — where a later phase's type is assignable to an earlier phase's parameter, an inversion still compiles
    harm: an order nothing decides permits every permutation while reading as a guarantee, so the interleaved read that turns the filling impure — the defect CONST-B3 names — reaches production with the rule green
    check: type-checker — composing the phases in the wrong order omits the required member, so the compiler names the phase that must come first; the sentence survives into the published declaration as that member's own name, which is what carries it into a consumer's compiler
    example:
      wrong: "write(decide(read(raw))) — hand-sequenced; every permutation type-checks, so the order is a comment"
      right: "read : Raw -> ReadDone, decode : ReadDone -> DecodeDone, decide : DecodeDone -> DecideDone — decode cannot receive what read has not produced"
  - id: CONST-B4
    title: Dependencies Point Inward
    gate: lint
    do: let the shell import the core; wire all implementations at one composition root
    dont: let the core import the shell, the database, or the framework
    harm: a decision layer chained to infrastructure can't be tested or replaced
    check: import-graph lint
  - id: CONST-B5
    title: Decode, Never Cast
    gate: lint
    do: turn outside data (bytes, serialized text, a foreign type) into a domain type via a decode returning a typed result
    dont:
      - assert type with an unchecked cast (`as`, `as unknown as`, `as any`)
      - assert type with a suppression comment
    harm: a shape nothing verified; everything downstream trusts a check that never ran
    check: lint — no unchecked casts or suppression comments on outside data
    example:
      wrong: config := value as Config
      right: "config := decode(value) : Result<ParseError, Config>"
  - id: CONST-P3
    title: Purity Is Per Function, Not Per Folder
    gate: review
    do: judge pure-versus-effectful by return type alone
    dont: infer it from a folder, package, or "library versus application"
    harm: a database-driver mislabeled "pure," a parser "impure," because of where it lives
    check: review — return type decides; the lint behind CONST-P1
    example:
      pure: "decide : Command -> Result<DomainError, Decision>"
      effectful: "load : OrderId -> Effect<Order, NotFound> — owns effects"
```

## Article III — Verification

```yaml
rules:
  - id: CONST-T15
    title: The Testing Trophy
    gate: review
    do: invest in order — static analysis first, then properties on the core where CONST-T14 grants them, then composition through the sandwich (CONST-B3), then contracts at the published edge; the order is the doctrine, a count of tests per layer is not
    dont:
      - gate anything on a numeric layer width or a layer-naming table — the widths were refuted instrumentation, not law
      - build a Test Pyramid — a wide base of helper unit tests buries logic in I/O and leaves the untested middle
    harm: investment spent where the compiler and the mutator already decide; the untested middle stays untested while the suite looks broad
    check: review — each authored test names its observer and the step of the order it earns, never a width
  - id: CONST-T8
    title: Test Public Functions Directly, Pure Logic with Mutation
    gate: review
    do: test the public API with real inputs and outputs; test internal calculation and branching logic with mutation tests (and properties only when CONST-T14 requires them); never write dedicated unit tests for code that only forwards calls between components
    dont:
      - write unit tests for intermediate helper functions that only pass data to other functions
      - mix I/O code or adapters into the same mutation test run as pure calculation logic
      - mock a dependency when only one real implementation exists
    harm: unit-testing intermediate layers locks in private implementation details without catching real bugs; mocking real code gives false confidence; business rules stay tangled with I/O
    check: review — every test calls either a public export or a pure decision function, never a private forwarding helper
  - id: CONST-T14
    title: Properties Where the Surface Cannot Reach
    gate: review
    do: prove a pure decision with a property when a universal over generated input, or a refusal no generated law can express, cannot be reached from the published surface; the type is the generator
    dont:
      - cover the core with hand-picked example unit tests
      - write a property for a decision already fully pinned from above just because the decision is important
    harm: a green suite that tests only the cases you imagined; or a property farm that restates the public contract and dies with it
    check: review — each authored property names the universal the public surface cannot reach
  - id: CONST-T3
    title: Mutation Is the Measure
    gate: mutation
    do: gate a named, change-relevant mutated set at a perfect kill score; the set names the behavior it covers, and its scope is a cost decision, never a fault-majority claim; kill a survivor with a sharper property or by deleting the dead branch it exploits
    dont:
      - reach the number by a suppression comment
      - reach the number by narrowing the mutated set after the fact
      - reach the number by lowering the gate
      - let an empty mutated set pass
      - treat a raw mutation percentage as comparable across changes or codebases
    harm: a score certifying tests that notice nothing; an empty or author-shrunk set passing vacuously
    check: mutation gate (break = 100) on the declared mutated set; lint banning suppression, scope-narrowing, and an empty set
  - id: CONST-T13
    title: Mutation Also Grades the Tests
    gate: mutation
    do: fail a run whose mutants all died if an authored property file defends nothing the rest of the suite does not; opt out in the mutation config, never by deleting the file the gate named
    dont:
      - treat a perfect mutant score as proof every test pulled its weight
      - accuse a file that covered an unattributed kill
    harm: toothless properties accumulate; deleting them to silence the gate removes the only named contract
    check: mutation — the test-set verdict is part of the same run as the score
  - id: CONST-T4
    title: Behavior Lives Where the Mutator Sees It
    gate: lint
    do: put any code that can be wrong (transform, check, branch) in a file the mutator covers
    dont: place behavior in a declaration file (types, schemas, constant data), excluded from mutation
    harm: a bug hidden behind a perfect score, in a file nothing mutates
    check: lint — declaration files contain no behavior
  - id: CONST-T9
    title: Pin the Published Contract Before You Delete a Path
    gate: review
    do: before removing or replacing a published operation, pin its observables (value, error variant, serialized document, process result) with examples or properties whose expected side is not the implementation under change; if the old operation still runs, compare old and new on the same published inputs until they agree, then delete old
    dont:
      - pin private functions
      - derive expected values by running the implementation under change
      - treat a mutation or property score as proof a deleted published capability still exists — those are blind to absence
      - leave a persisted gold after the old path is gone unless the gold is externally authored, independently gated, and cheap to re-bless
    harm: a rebuild silently drops a capability; same-session gold blesses the bug; a clean score after a delete is a silent regression
    check: review — pins call only published names; each expected value names an independent source (spec clause, second implementation, or a hand-written oracle next to the constructor), never the subject's own output or a second build of it
  - id: CONST-T10
    title: The Oracle Is Not the System Under Test
    gate: review
    do: every assertion has an oracle the SUT did not produce — a spec literal, a fixture not generated by importing the module, a law relating two views of the same value, or a second implementation; generated round-trip laws on a type cover what the type accepts and nothing it should reject, so a hand-written refusal survives beside them at any specifiable refusal boundary
    dont:
      - compute expected by calling the SUT
      - assert collaborator call graphs
      - treat generated accept-laws as full coverage of a refinement
    harm: a green suite that cannot fail when the behavior is wrong; widening a refinement leaves generated laws green
    check: review — plus sabotage (after green, break one core law and one published field; at least one test must go red)
  - id: CONST-T11
    title: Snapshots and Differentials Are Development-Time Evidence, Never Committed Artifacts
    gate: lint
    do: use stored-output snapshots and same-lineage differentials only as development-time evidence in a dot-prefixed, always-gitignored scratch directory; the committed suite asserts intended behavior against an oracle the subject did not produce
    dont:
      - commit a stored-output snapshot, a recorded-output fixture, or a differential-comparison test
      - keep scratch evidence past the commit that lands the intended-contract tests
    harm: a committed capture re-records whatever the subject currently does and passes forever, certifying nothing; a committed differential passes whenever both builds of the same subject share a bug
    check: lint — no snapshot API call and no same-lineage differential import in a committed test file; review — the scratch directory is gitignored and empty at commit
  - id: CONST-T12
    title: What a Test Does Comes from What It Calls, Not Its Filename
    gate: lint
    do: classify what a test is by what it imports and calls — public exports or pure logic under mutation — never by its folder, filename, or file extension
    dont: decide which testing rules apply to a file based on its name or suffix
    harm: renaming a test file secretly stops its rules from running while the test suite still looks complete
    check: lint — no linter or test runner rules that pick tests by filename suffix
```

## Article IV — Organization

```yaml
rules:
  - id: CONST-N1
    title: Organized by What It Does
    gate: review
    do: organize by workflow and capability; keep code that changes together, together
    dont: organize by what the system has (entities, technical layers)
    harm: one change scattered across the tree
    check: review — one change touches one capability subtree
  - id: CONST-N2
    title: Names Scream the Domain
    gate: lint
    do: name files and folders for the job they do — a name must answer "of what?"
    dont:
      - use layer names (`core`, `shell`)
      - use junk drawers (`util`, `service`, `manager`)
      - use a suffix no rule keys on
    harm: files no one can locate; meaningless buckets
    check: filename lint — allowed suffixes; banned layer and junk-drawer names
  - id: CONST-N3
    title: Fits in the Head
    gate: review
    do: give a module one responsibility; split it when a test needs elaborate setup (the signal it has several)
    dont: accumulate unrelated concerns in one module
    harm: modules no one can fully reason about; brittle, sprawling tests
    check: review — fixture difficulty is the decomposition signal
```

---

## Article V — Conduct

```yaml
rules:
  - id: CONST-G3
    title: Constitutional Violations Are Automatic P0 Failures
    gate: review
    do: treat every undeclared violation of this constitution during review as an automatic, non-negotiable P0 failure; reject the change unconditionally with zero appeals and no severity downgrades unless explicitly declared under CONST-W3
    dont:
      - downgrade an undeclared constitutional breach to an advisory, P1, P2, or non-blocking finding
      - treat a CONST-W3 declaration as optional prose — an explicit declaration in the change itself is the only legal waiver, and it must name the rule and the case
      - accept a promise of follow-up repair or expedience plea to bypass an active rule without a CONST-W3 declaration
    harm: constitutional rules decay into optional suggestions; agents negotiate away core architecture to ship faster; unblocked violations calcify into precedent
    check: review — every undeclared constitutional violation is graded P0 and blocks approval unconditionally; any review that waives or downgrades an undeclared violation is rejected
  - id: CONST-S1
    title: Depth Over Expedience
    gate: review
    do: fix the root cause; restructure when the design is wrong
    dont: patch the symptom or bypass a boundary to ship faster
    harm: the bug returns
    check: review — the change names the root cause it fixes
  - id: CONST-W1
    title: Scope Discipline
    gate: review
    do: execute accepted scope in full
    dont: reduce scope mid-task because it grew complex, without the author's consent
    harm: half-finished work; wasted effort second-guessing intent
    check: review — delivered scope matches accepted scope
  - id: CONST-S2
    title: First Principles Over Precedent
    gate: review
    do: justify a pattern by these principles — surrounding code is evidence of what exists, never of what is correct
    dont:
      - justify by "that is how it's done elsewhere"
      - copy a neighbouring file as a template — code age grants no immunity
    harm: unexamined defaults calcify into rules; one slop pattern seeds the next by imitation, and the average drifts down
    check: review — a choice defended by precedent, or by the file next to it, is rejected
  - id: CONST-S3
    title: API-First Discovery
    gate: review
    do: define the outside contract first, then derive use cases, decisions, and machinery beneath it; model only what a known requirement needs
    dont: build a domain abstraction for a hypothetical future
    harm: speculative structure that never pays off and constrains what comes after
    check: review — every abstraction traces to a known requirement
  - id: CONST-W2
    title: Challenge Before You Commit
    gate: review
    do: subject a large or irreversible choice to a deliberate challenge (another agent, a person, or rigorous self-examination), record it with the decision, judge it by the harm it names
    dont:
      - appeal to a tribunal or standing authority
      - let a challenge become a clause quoted against a choice
    harm: a costly, hard-to-reverse direction taken with no one trying to break it first
    check: review — the challenge is recorded with the decision
  - id: CONST-W3
    title: No Silent Bypass
    gate: review
    do: when you break a rule here — knowingly, or because it was wrong for this case — say so, in the open, in the change itself
    dont: conceal a bypass
    harm: two failures — the breach and the hiding of it; the next reader trusts a rule quietly broken
    check: review — every rule breach is declared in the change that contains it
  - id: CONST-S4
    title: Subtract Before You Add
    gate: review
    do:
      - treat every line as a liability — removal is the default response to slop at every scale; adding is the exception you justify
      - small — unify duplicates, make bad states unrepresentable, delete a branch instead of guarding it
      - structural — when the root violates this document and breeds a bug class, rebuild the core (published contract pinned first (CONST-T9); decomposed into shippable milestones) rather than prune leaves off a rotten trunk
      - distrust existing structure — assume rotten until it proves it conforms
    dont:
      - extend a copy-paste cluster with copy N+1
      - add a helper when removing or unifying one does the job
      - patch around a rotten core to keep it alive
      - treat code as sound because it compiles, is large, or is old
      - mistake taste ("I'd write it differently") for rot
    harm: the codebase only grows; rot survives every patch and regrows; each copied pattern seeds the next, and the average drifts down
    check: review reads the net line delta — a refactor/improvement/chore that adds net lines states why and names what it deleted (features and their tests are exempt); a fix that leaves a named root violation standing is rejected; "rotten" names the invariant the core breaks; a structural rebuild ships a CONST-T9 pin on every published path it deletes
    example:
      wrong: add formatPhone() beside the three formatters already there
      right: delete the three, keep one parameterised formatter
      wrong_state: add a guard for the impossible state the record permits
      right_state: delete the record; a tagged union makes the state unconstructable

```
